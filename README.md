# What is Customer Segmentation?
Customer segmentation is the process of breaking down the customer base into various groups of people that are similar in many ways that are important to marketing, such as gender, age, interests, and various spending habits.

Companies that use customer segmentation operate under the premise that each customer has unique needs that must be addressed through a particular marketing strategy. Businesses strive to develop a deeper understanding of the customers they are aiming for. Therefore, they must have a clear objective and should be designed to meet the needs of every single customer. A deeper understanding of client preferences and the criteria for identifying profitable segments can also be gained by businesses through the data collected.
